Revision history for ``pannb``
==============================

-  v0.1.3: fix ``README.rst``: use hard-coded links to guarantee it compiles everywhere (including PyPI)

-  v0.1.2: minor improvements

   -  support pandoc 2.17 and drop older pandoc: improvements in ipynb handling made in upstream. See `pandoc 2.17 release notes <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.17>`__.
   -  speed up by rewriting ``walk_and_convert_jupytext_metadata`` using a prepare function ``prepare_jupytext_metadata`` instead.

   v0.1.2 is not publishable to PyPI as the ``README.rst`` has directives.

-  v0.1.1: support pandoc 2.15â€“16 where its ipynb reader/writer are improved (See https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.15) and is required here.

-  v0.1.0: first release and proof of concept.
